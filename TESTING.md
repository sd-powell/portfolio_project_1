Testing was conducted continuously throughout the development process to ensure a functional and user-friendly website. Chrome Developer Tools were extensively utilised during the build to identify and resolve issues promptly. Regular testing allowed for a smoother development process and ensured the final product met quality standards.

Throughout the development process, ChatGPT was utilized as a valuable resource for brainstorming ideas, refining content, and troubleshooting challenges. By offering alternative solutions and best practices, ChatGPT contributed significantly to the website’s overall quality and functionality.

Each page is tested using Chrome Developer Tools to ensure that it is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.
