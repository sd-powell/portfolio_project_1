## Design

<a id=item-four></a>

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of my site is inspired by the hero background image. This image evokes the vibrant atmosphere of a nightclub, with its interplay of dark spaces and dynamic highlights of orange and blue. These colors set the tone for a modern, energetic, and immersive user experience.

To create a cohesive and visually appealing color palette for my site, I used the [Palette Generator tool](https://palettegenerator.com/). This allowed me to extract the predominant colors directly from the hero background image.

Using this tool ensured that my color scheme harmonized with the key visuals of the site, creating a consistent and immersive user experience. To ensure consistency and maintainability, I declared all color values as CSS variables in the :root selector. This approach allows me to apply colors consistently throughout the site and makes it easy to update the color scheme by changing the values in one place.

The primary colors for my site are black (#000000) and white (#ffffff), providing a clean and timeless foundation that enhances readability and usability.

To draw attention to key areas, I incorporated highlight colors:
* `#d27d60` Used to emphasize elements that convey warmth and energy.
* `#f5e5df` Used as a soft backgound tint to contrast the white background.
* `#1987a3` Applied to call-to-action buttons and other interactive elements, creating a sense of trust and urgency.
* `#222222` Applied to the about sections as an alternative to the black primary colour.

These highlights were carefully selected to contrast against the primary colors, ensuring important elements stand out and guide the user’s focus effectively.

<a id=item-five></a>

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the selected fonts for the site, ensuring high-quality and easily accessible typography.

* **h1, h2 and h3 headings:** The font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text=Get%20ready%20to%20elevate%20your%20event&query=open+sans) was chosen for its modern, clean, and sans-serif style. This typeface draws inspiration from the traditional posters and signs of the Montserrat neighborhood in Buenos Aires, lending a sense of history while maintaining a contemporary aesthetic.

![Montserrat Font Example](documentation/montserrat.webp)

* **paragraph elements:** The font [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) was chosen for it's friendly and approchable look. With its humanist design, open letterforms, and low x-height, Open Sans delivers both warmth and readability. Its versatility and high legibility make it an excellent choice for paragraph text, ensuring a comfortable reading experience across various devices and screen sizes.

![Open Sans Font Example](documentation/open-sans.webp)

* **social media icons:** [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library icons were used for the social media icons and icons in the mixes section.

<a id=item-six></a>

### Imagery

The imagery on the site was chosen to reflect the vibrancy and minimalist aesthetic of the hero image. High-contrast visuals with bright, bold colors create an engaging and visually striking experience for users. The use of dynamic imagery complements the mood of the site, drawing attention while maintaining a clean, modern design. All images were sourced from [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/).

<a id=item-seven></a>

### Wireframes

Wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop views were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). These wireframes helped map out the structure and layout of the site, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices. The design process focused on responsive layout adjustments to provide an intuitive interface for users on various screen sizes.

## Testing

Please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for all testing carried out.

## Solved Issues & Bugs

| No | Bug                                  | How I solved the issue                              |
| :- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | When the html code was first tested using the w3c validator, the report showed a button class had been incorrectly used rather than an anchor tag for the call to action buttons. | The `<button>` tag was changed to an `<a>` tag on all pages featuring the CTA buttons. |
| 2  | The Lighthouse report showed that accessibility could be improved on the 'Book Your Event Now' buttons. As background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.  | A darker shade of `#1987a3` was found using [Colorkit.co](https://colorkit.co/color-shades-generator/) and the color was replaced in the `:root` css variable with `#14758d` |
| 3  | The booking form allowed white space characters to be accepted by the validation when submitting the form. | White space validation was implemented on the `<input>` tag using regular expression `required pattern="\S(.*\S)?" title="This field is required"`.
