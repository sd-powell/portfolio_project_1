### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of my site is inspired by the hero background image. This image evokes the vibrant atmosphere of a nightclub, with its interplay of dark spaces and dynamic highlights of orange and blue. These colors set the tone for a modern, energetic, and immersive user experience.

To create a cohesive and visually appealing color palette for my site, I used the [Palette Generator tool](https://palettegenerator.com/). This allowed me to extract the predominant colors directly from the hero background image.

Using this tool ensured that my color scheme harmonized with the key visuals of the site, creating a consistent and immersive user experience. To ensure consistency and maintainability, I declared all color values as CSS variables in the :root selector. This approach allows me to apply colors consistently throughout the site and makes it easy to update the color scheme by changing the values in one place.

The primary colors for my site are black and white, providing a clean and timeless foundation that enhances readability and usability.

To draw attention to key areas, I incorporated highlight colors:
* `#d27d60` Used to emphasize elements that convey warmth and energy.
* `#1987a3` Applied to call-to-action buttons and other interactive elements, creating a sense of trust and urgency.

These highlights were carefully selected to contrast against the primary colors, ensuring important elements stand out and guide the user’s focus effectively.
